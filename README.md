- 👋 Hi, I’m @v0yg3r
- 👀 I build websites — and I hope those websites guide participants through liminal states of becoming by blatantly modeling the natural/collaborative (more explanation in source code).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development using theodinproject.com (and all the wonderful resources linked there).
- 💞️ If you're interested in web design for art, post-activism, AI, occultish summinings, or whatever, hit me up. Just beginning this new journey on 11/01/2021.

Motivations for web dev span a  as an act of post-activism — as understood through Bayo Akomolafe's writings.
